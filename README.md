# Game Like Thingy

- A really easy code for a game
- Using QGraphicsScene
- Maybe useful to put in Qt Examples

## Expected Controls
- Up/Down/Right/left Keyboard arrow keys for movement
	- In default controls, the up key should move sprite upward (Northward)
	- In alternate controls, the Up Key will move sprite forward
- Mouse pointer to decide direction of sprite forward pointing
- Alternate controls... Q and E to rotate sprite
- Spacebar or LMB to attack
